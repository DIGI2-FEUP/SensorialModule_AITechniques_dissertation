Repository for Master Thesis: Application of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to a Sensorial Module

In Data Collection are the programs related to this task. It has a pH probe calibrator, a program to collect data, a script to process the new logs and attach them to the dataset, a program to process the images and scripts to build the rgb dataset and merge the datasets.

In Data Processing are the scripts used to manage the dataset, both the collected dataset from the physical testbed and the laser welding dataset.

In old, there are unused programs developed in the scope of this project, such as tests developed with unused sensors

Schematic of the setup used to collect data:
